#Batch 6 - Program 1

#ask the user to input a string with spaces in the beginning, and initialize a counter for the beginning spaces

#loop through the input to count the beginning spaces by finding the index where the first non-space character appears in the string

#create and display a new string without the beginning spaces by starting from the first non-space character
